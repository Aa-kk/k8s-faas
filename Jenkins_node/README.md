# Jenkins Node
contains files to deploy a jenkins server in the aws cloud
* NB: You would have to create a key pair first using "ssh-keygen -t rsa" and place both keys in the appropraite directory to create the ec2 instance 
* I used a golden image ami which I created to ease the process. (Most neccessary tools were already installed)
